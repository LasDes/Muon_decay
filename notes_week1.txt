Feyman's diagram. Integral. Magneticmoment of Muons
Rate to degree(degree from zenith) chart
Flat Earth approximation.
    Muons made from a plane in detector detectable area.
        How many survives.
            high energy -> lives longer, low -> live shorter
            Gamma factor -> lorentz transformation, time in muon frame
        Monte Carlo method: ex. finding pi by generating rand. numbers
            When a results cannot be calculated mathematically or physically
        Time dialation and length contraction. Muon frame vs observing frame.
    Energy lost formula.

Todo:
    Determine if a muon survives based on a given distance and a given energy level.
        Practice special relativity.
        E_tot = gamma m c^2
        E_rest = m c^2
        Units in high energy units. (3, 5, 10 GeV: kinetic energy) 
        Traelling in vacuum.

    Histogram, normal distribution
    Cern Root

    Next step:
        Expand to 2D:
            Add x axis

    Questions:
        Am I doing this right lmao. Should each muon survival rate be uniform distribution or normal distribution around theoretical value?
    John Taylor: Error Analysis
    To Do:
        Cern Root, one line probability equation.

    Todo:
        don't connect the lines for simulated data.
        add error bars to simulated data.
        convert Horizontal axis to angle
        cos^2(theta)
        ANALYTICAL EXPRESSION

    Questions:
        Error? Standard deviation of mean (SDOM) or just Standard deviation?
        How to calculate error is there's only technically one measurement?
    Todo:
        graph using derived expression.
        error (N)^1/2/N
        Add statistics in 2D graph.
        15KM up
        Geometric acceptance:
            Cone,
            Uniformly distributed directions
        Different telescope angles
    Think:
        Better model for muon creation instead of uniformly on a single plane.
