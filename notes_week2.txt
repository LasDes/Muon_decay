    Binomial distribution apporaches normal distribution when N -> large

    Simulation:
        Imagine a rectangle larger than the ellipses, double for loop,
        Use fraction of area of sphere to calculate probability of angles.
        Compare it to cos^2(theta)

    Parameters of the telescope:
        psi: 9.7 degrees

    A/Z, use effective A, effective Z
        Reference: A/Z = 4.99
    Use step distance instead of step time
    Time needs to be adjusted when calculating time elapsed.
