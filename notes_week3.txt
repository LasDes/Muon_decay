        How to incorporate energy loss into montecarlo simulation?
        Determining a new probability and then applying montecarlo would require a particle to pass compounded probability to survive.
        I don't think that'll be correct
    Current simulation steps:
        Get initial energy level and set vertical distance,
        Enter telescope energy for loop
        Determine ellipse area, initiate muon point by point,
        Determine initial direction and if it will enter the telescope,
        Enter energy loss loop, using a set time step to calculate new energy and accumulated time.
        Use previous step to calculate decay probability,
        Using montecarlo simulation to determing if particle survives.
        Loop until particle reaches telescope or dies or runs out of energy
